# Diary-REST-API
Diary REST API made with python and flask framework ;)

# Description
I made this REST API to register all of the notes you have on the day, all diaries have an unique id and also get the date you wrote them.
This API works witb auth, so make sure to register yourself and log-in before accessing the /diaries route.

Don't forget to write your own .env file following the .env.example file!
